## Pawpoint

Design Expo project for the CSC 132 series. Pawpoint is a website integrating various utilities from LA Tech resources. It includes account creation and connection between students and teachers in personal or class chatrooms, QR scanning for adding friends, classes, and attendance records, multi-functional calendars and event tracking, and easily navigable pages for campus advice and resources.
Pawpoint is built in Java, HTML, and Python, utilizing Flask for web framework, SQLAlchemy for database handling, and WTForms for form validation and rendering. Various Python libraries are used for features like calendar control and QR implementation. To display cross-account functionality, the site was hosted on a Render server for the expo demo.
